    summary:
      "Eight years after Puttaswamy, facial recognition is spreading across Indian cities. This paper asks whether the proportionality test can keep pace.",
    body: "When the Supreme Court recognised privacy as a fundamental right, it set out a four-part proportionality test for any State intrusion: legality, legitimate aim, necessity and procedural safeguards.\n\nFacial recognition systems now deployed at railway stations and airports rarely rest on a specific statute. This paper maps those deployments against each limb of the test and finds the 'legality' requirement most often unmet.\n\nIt closes with three recommendations: a statutory basis for public-space biometrics, independent audits of accuracy across demographic groups, and a time-bound data retention rule.",
